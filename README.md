An alacritty port of the [Noctis theme](https://github.com/liviuschera/noctis).

## How to use
The theme definitions are located in the [themes](themes/) folder. You can either copy the content
of the `yml` file directly into your `alacritty.yml`, or download the `yml` file to your config
folder and then import it in you `alacritty.yml`. For instance,

```yml
import:
  - ~/.config/alacritty/noctis-uva.yaml
```
